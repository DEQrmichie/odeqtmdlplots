\arguments{
\item{station}{Monitoring station to be used. Can be single station or vector of stations.}

\item{startdate}{Startdate of data pull}

\item{enddate}{Enddate of data pull}

\item{buffer}{Value < 1 used to draw boxed of unlikely impariemnts. Defaults to 0.80}

\item{label_y}{vertical adjustment of "Impairment unlikely" label}

\item{highlight_year}{year, or vector of years to highlight on the plot}

\item{include_station_legend}{TRUE/FALSE for whether to show the station legend. Defauls to false}

\item{include_highlight_legend}{TRUE/FALSE for whether to show the highlighted year legend. Defauls to false}

\description{
This function produces a graph pf seven day average daily maximum river
temperatures for a single monitoring location. These graphs are intended
to be placed in the thrid section of the temperture TMDL. Data is pulled
from AWQMS using the AWQMSdata package.  Choose a monitoring location with
sufficient continuous temperature (many years worth of continuous data).
Criteria line is drawn based of fish use station desgination.
Blue boxed represent times of unlikely impairments. They are drawn at the
first and last day in dataset with a value of buffer * criteria.
