\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame of data to be graphed}

\item{station_col}{Name of column containing station ID, name ,or grouping label. This is the value used for facet. Default is "MLocID".}

\item{date_col}{Name of the datetime column. Format as character in "yyyy-mm-dd". Defaults is "SampleStartDate".}

\item{result_col}{Name of column containing result information. Default is 'Result_Numeric'.}

\item{temp_criteria_col}{Name of column containing the numeric non spawning temperature criteria. Defaults is "Temp_Criteria".}

\item{spawn_start_col}{Name of column containing the spawning start date. Format as character in "mm-dd". Defaults is "SpawnStart".}

\item{spawn_end_col}{Name of column containing the spawning end date. Format as character in "mm-dd". Defaults is "SpawnEnd".}

\item{critical_plot}{Logical if the plot should highlight the critical period. The critical period shown on the plot is the same for all data in df. If different periods are desired the data will need to be separated and sent to this function individually.}

\item{critical_start}{Start of the critical period. Format as character in "mm-dd" or "guess". Guess rounds the date down by half month periods based on the earliest date temperatures exceed the temperature criteria in any given year. Default is "guess".}

\item{critical_end}{End of the critical period. Format as character in "mm-dd" or "guess. Guess rounds the date up by half month periods based on the latest date temperatures exceed the temperature criteria in a given year. Default is "guess".}

\item{facet}{Logical if the plot should be a facet wrap using the station_col name to facet by. Default is FALSE.}

\item{y_axis_max}{Maximum value for the y-axis. Default is 28.}

\item{y_axis_int}{Interval between y-axis labels. Default is 5.}

\item{y_label}{Label for the y-axis. Default is '7DADM Temperature (deg-C)'.}

\item{facet_cols}{Number of columns in the facet wrap. Ignored if facet = FALSE. Default is 2.}

\description{
This function produces a Tukey style box plot of seven day average daily maximum river
temperatures grouped by the first and second half of each month for one or more monitoring locations.
The month is split on the 15th with the first group including all results measured on the
1st through the 14th day and the second group including all results measured on the 15th
through the end of the month.
These plots are intended to be placed in the seasonal variation and critical period section of
temperature TMDLs. The temperature criteria line is drawn based on the
fish use designation for each station.
A yellow box can be included to represent times of impairment.
