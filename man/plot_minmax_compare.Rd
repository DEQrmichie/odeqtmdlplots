\description{
Creates a plot showing the daily minimum and maximum water temperature
for 2 monitoring locations. Intended to be used to show the difference
between upstream and downstream monitoring locations. Source datafram
must have at least 4 columns: Date, station, minimum, and maximum.
If only 1 monitoring location is desired, only include the upstream
location. Dataframe must be in 'long' format, but with seperate
columns for daily minimum and maximum.
